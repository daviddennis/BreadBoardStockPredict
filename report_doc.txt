Stocks Data Pipeline & Machine Learning Model Report
====================================================

Data:
	Symbols Analyzed: We retrieved and processed data for a handful of prominent stock symbols, including AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, and AMZN.
	Data Range: The dataset spans multiple years, providing a generous amount of data used for the model's prediction.
Model Performance:
	Model Used: A simple linear regression model, using sklearn was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.
	Training & Testing: We used an 80/20 split for our dataset.
	Accuracy: As expected for stock prices, the model wasn't perfect. A linear regression model may be too simple to account for all the factors influencing stock prices.

We implemented a data pipeline & ETL process via Redis Queue.
